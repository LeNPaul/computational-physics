<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model" target="_blank">The Ising model</a> is a model of how magnets work at the atomic level, and is an interesting physical problem with a complicated solution. If you actually try to solve this problem analytically (i.e. with pen and paper), it would actually take longer than the age of the universe, but with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" target="_blank">Monte Carlo algorithms</a> you can solve it in a reasonable time (you also end up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWUTBnvGegg" target="_blank">cool visualizations</a>).</p>

<p>The plot below shows how the magnetization of the system evolves over time for two different systems. I let the simulations run for a period of time before plotting the results, so the magnetizations appear to fluctuate around a certain magnetization value:</p>
