<p>As it turns out, most problems in quantum mechanics actually don't have an analytic solution (something you can solve with pen and paper). For physical systems more complicated than the hydrogen atom, you typically need to utilize numerical techniques to solve. One famous technique is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerov's_method" target="_blank">Numerov algorithm</a>, which I implemented to solve some special cases.</p>

<p>The plot below is an example that shows the probability of finding a particle within an electric potential:</p>
